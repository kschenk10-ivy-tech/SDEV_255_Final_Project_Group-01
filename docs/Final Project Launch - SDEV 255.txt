SDEV 255 - Final Project Launch


This assignment’s purpose is to prepare you for the final project.  This assignment will prepare you to collaborate with your classmates in order to be successful in completing your final project.  There are 3 Steps below that you must complete in order to fulfill this assignment’s requirements.  The text highlighted in yellow are the items you must turn-in / complete in order for the assignment to be considered complete.


Be sure to read the Final Project Instructions / Requirements before beginning this assignment:

Step 1: Communication


When working on a project, it is very important to communicate with your team members.  Establishing a line of communication will be the first step in whether a project becomes successful or not.  In this part of the project your teammates will need to choose a “project manager” to help establish a communication plan, and stick with that plan throughout the project.  You can communicate using asynchronous communication utilizing tools such as Discord, Slack, or Teams, or you can schedule weekly meetings utilizing a tool such as Zoom.


Here are a couple of tools you can use to establish your plan:
* Discord - https://discord.com/.  A chat and video conferencing application where you can have chat logs, and upload files.  This is similar to how Slack would work in industry.  This video is a short introduction into how to use Discord: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIqyPJQAgT4&ab_channel=TechInsider
* Zoom - In your IvyLearn Menu.  This application allows you to meet via teleconference at a scheduled date and time.
* Slack/Teams - This can be used as alternative to Discord, however, for beginners Discord seems to be easier to manage


Do the following:
* Create a Google / Word Document and name it Team_Name_Final_Project_Launch.  You only need to have one document per group
* In this document, write a paragraph or two describing your communication plan.  It can be using one of the apps above, or using weekly schedule dates and times in order to meet
* DO NOT RELY ON EMAIL.  Email is a good starting point, but should not be your only/main form of communication.






Step 2 - Project Collaboration


In order to collaborate for your final project, you will need to create a Github account (one per group).  Although you have used Github throughout this course, you will need to enable/utilize the collaboration features for this service.  To get a better understanding of how collaboration works in Github, read the following resources:


* Be Social - https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/be-social
* Fork a Repo - https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo
* Inviting Collaborators - https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository
* https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests


You can either utilize the collaboration features, or utilize forking and pull requests in order to collaborate with other teammates.


Do the following:
* Have your project manager go to github.com and create a new repository entitled SDEV_255_Final_Project_TeamName
* Either enable the collaboration features of Github, or provide a link for your teammates to fork the project
* Teammates should fork the project, and perhaps create a readme to test the pull request / collaboration features of Github
* Copy and paste the link to your Github repository in your Final Project Launch document


Step 3 - Project Management and Roles


During this project, you will need to assign individual roles to your team members, and keep up with each other's feature implementations.  Each team member needs to pick a role, and will need to manage the project based on those roles.  There are several roles / examples you can assign team members.  Here are a couple of examples of how you can separate roles:


* Front-End/Back-End/Middleware (or Database)
* Designer / Developer
* Break roles into implementing certain features / web pages


However your team decides to designate roles is up to you, but the above are a few ways teams can operate. 


In order to keep track of your project, you will utilize one part of the Agile Project Management methodology known as Kanban Boards.  Kanban Boards allow you to assign roles and tasks, and give a due date as well as a progress update to each of the tasks.  Watch the following video for an introduction to Kanban Boards

We will be using the Trello board software in order to create a Kanban board for your team.  The following is an example of how to use Trello to perform project management on your software application:

YOU NEED TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE THE TRELLO BOARD AS YOU COMPLETE TASKS.  EACH WEEK YOU WILL NEED TO SUBMIT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE TRELLO BOARD AS PART OF YOUR DISCUSSION BOARD ASSIGNMENT






Do the following:
* Have your project manager go to trello.com and create a new Trello board, and add your teammates to that board
* Discuss what roles your teammates will be designated, and create a workflow utilizing Kanban boards to assign tasks
* Open up your Final Project Launch, and copy and paste your Trello board URL
* In the document, describe each team members roles and responsibilities
